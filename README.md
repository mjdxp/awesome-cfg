# awesome-cfg

My personal configuration and theme for Awesome WM.

Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/mjdxp/awesome-cfg.git` and copy the files to `~/.config/awesome.`

This uses Collision, so make sure that's installed before using this.

This is mostly just for easy setup for new Linux installations. Feel free to use/modify it to your liking.
